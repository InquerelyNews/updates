# 🗺️ Inquerely v2.0.5 – Mapbox Integration & Advanced Geolocation

**Release date:** April 2025 
**Type:** Minor  
**Status:** Stable  

## 📋 Overview

This release brings full Mapbox support, giving you a slick, interactive map that turns raw OSINT data into something you can actually see—and trust. Drop a pin, cluster a thousand more, and still keep your bearings.

## ✨ What’s new

### 🗺️ Interactive Mapbox map
- **What it is:** Plug-and-play Mapbox GL JS canvas that feels like Google Maps on espresso.
- **How to use:** Hit the “Map view” toggle on any search page—done.

### 📍 Multi-source geolocation
- **What it is:** We fuse IP, GPS, and file metadata so you get a single, confident dot on the globe.
- **Why you’ll like it:** Triangulation cuts the noise; you spend less time second-guessing coordinates.
- **How to use:** It kicks in automatically the moment your query smells like a location.

### 🎯 Smart markers
- **What it is:** Markers that group themselves when you zoom out and split when you zoom in—no manual tidy-up.
- **Why you’ll like it:** Even 10 000 pins stay buttery smooth on a laptop or phone.
- **How to use:** Just pinch, scroll, or swipe; the clustering handles the rest.

## 🔄 Polishes & tweaks

- **40 % faster** tile loads—maps appear before you finish blinking.
- Fresh, minimalist skin for every map control; no more 90s GIS chic.
- GPS coordinates for sensitive targets are now AES-encrypted at rest.
- Full screen-reader support: every marker and popup talks to assistive tech.

## 🐛 Bug squashes

- iOS Safari finally stops drifting when you ask for “current location.”
- Tiny-screen auto-zoom no longer swallows the entire continent.
- Ghost markers that refused to leave after filters are exorcised for good.
